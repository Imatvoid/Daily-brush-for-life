SOME SAID it was the **disruption** of some **flights** to LaGuardia airport early on January 25th that **persuaded** him. The air-traffic controllers at Donald Trump’s local airport—unpaid after 35 days of the government shutdown—had voted with their feet. Yet the great climb-down the president affected later in the day had in reality been on the cards for some time.

He shut down the government last year in a **bid** to strong-arm the Democrats to fund his promised southern border-wall. Yet they **flat refused**, which was also **predictable**. Most Americans don’t want the wall, especially on the left. And the president had helpfully **made it clear that** the mounting socio-economic damage caused by the shutdown was on him. Naturally, most Americans—including some of Mr Trump’s loyal supporters—therefore **blamed** him for it. Mr Trump’s **ratings** have fallen to their lowest level in a year. The latest **poll** suggest only 37% **approve** of his performance—a **shockingly low** number at a time of near full employment.
